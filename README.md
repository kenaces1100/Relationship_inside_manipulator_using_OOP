# Relationship_inside_manipulator_using_OOP
Relationships between objects within the manipulator use OOP

# Background:
Hello World, I am currently an embedded software engineer, I have a passion for programming and I want to express my thoughts about the objects around me and put them into lines of code. Below is a small project about relationships inside a robot, inspired by my graduation thesis, but there is another one that is completely in C++ following the concept of object-oriented programming.
A beginner could view this as a reference for their new journey.
For guys with experience, constructive feedback is always welcome.
